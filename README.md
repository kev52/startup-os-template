## The Problem

You've read the books. *Lean Startup. Inspired. Start with Why.*

But here you are — ideas scattered across Notion, Google Docs, and the back of your mind. You know the frameworks exist. You just can't seem to *apply* them.

Every decision still feels like guessing.

---

## The Solution

**Startup OS** is a free system that organizes your entire startup using 8 battle-tested frameworks — and an AI that interviews you to fill it all in.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Framework knowledge stuck in your head | Connected documents that build on each other |
| Scattered notes across 10 different tools | Everything in one place, version-controlled |
| "What should I focus on?" paralysis | Clear next steps based on your actual stage |
| Decisions made on gut feeling | Strategy grounded in proven methodology |

**The AI asks the hard questions.** The same ones investors will ask. The same ones your customers will make you answer eventually. Better to face them now — before you build the wrong thing.

---

## Built on Frameworks That Created $1 Trillion+ in Value

This isn't theory I invented. It's the actual systems behind the world's best companies:

- **Amazon** — Working Backwards (PR/FAQ method)
- **Silicon Valley's Top PMs** — Inspired by Marty Cagan
- **Y Combinator Companies** — The Mom Test, Lean Startup
- **Every Great Leader** — Start with Why
- **Continuous Discovery** — Teresa Torres' Opportunity Trees

I connected the dots, organized them into a system, and taught an AI to apply them to *your* startup.

## Start Now (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your Copy
Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page. Name it. Make it private.

### Step 2: Open with AI
Download [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) (free) or use [Cowork](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview) if you have Claude Max.

Open your new folder in the app.

### Step 3: Start Your Interview
Tell the AI:

```
Read WIZARD_PROMPT.md and help me set up my startup
```

**That's it.** The AI takes over from there. It will ask you questions, challenge your assumptions, and create your customized strategy documents.

## What's Inside

Your startup, organized:

```
your-startup/
├── 00_why/           # Your purpose (Start with Why)
├── 01_strategy/      # Your game plan (Good Strategy Bad Strategy)
├── 02_discovery/     # Customer research (The Mom Test)
├── 03_product/       # Vision & specs (Working Backwards, Inspired)
├── 04_validation/    # Stage tracking (Lean Startup)
├── 05_business/      # Business model & monetization
├── 06_design/        # Brand & design system
├── 07_engineering/   # Technical docs & ADRs
├── 08_growth/        # Marketing & channels
├── 09_operations/    # Team & processes
├── 10_finance/       # Projections & metrics
└── journal/          # Decision log & learnings
```

**Start with these 3:**
1. `00_why/why.md` — Your core belief
2. `03_product/pr_faq.md` — Your future press release
3. `04_validation/current_stage.md` — Where you are now

The AI will guide you through the rest.
