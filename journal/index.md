    E[📝 Experience] --> R[🔍 Reflect]
    R --> L[💡 Learn]

```

**Benefits:**

1. **Institutional Memory** — Know why decisions were made
2. **Onboarding** — New team members learn from history
3. **Pattern Recognition** — Spot recurring issues
4. **Accountability** — Track what we said we'd do

## ✍️ Writing Guidelines

When adding to the journal:

1. **Be specific** — Names, dates, numbers
2. **Include context** — What was happening at the time?
3. **Note the outcome** — What happened as a result?
4. **Extract learnings** — What would we do differently?
