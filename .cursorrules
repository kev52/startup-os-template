# Cursor AI Rules for Startup OS

## Project Context

This is a Startup Operating System repository that contains both:
1. **Documentation** - Strategy, product, business docs in markdown
2. **Source Code** - Application code in `src/`

## AI Behavior Guidelines

### Before Making Changes

1. **Read context first** - Check `00_why/`, `01_strategy/`, and `03_product/` before suggesting features
2. **Understand the stage** - Check `04_validation/current_stage.md` to understand where we are
3. **Follow existing patterns** - Look at existing code/docs before creating new ones

### Code Style

1. **Clean Architecture** - Follow SOLID principles
2. **Domain-Driven Design** - Understand the domain before coding
3. **No duplication** - Check for existing solutions in the codebase
4. **Simple first** - Start with the simplest solution, refactor later
5. **Modules over monoliths** - Organize code into logical modules

### Documentation Style

1. **Be concise** - Respect readers' time
2. **Use templates** - Follow existing document structures
3. **Update timestamps** - Mark "Last updated: [Date]" when changing docs
4. **Link related docs** - Cross-reference related information

### Commit Messages

Follow Conventional Commits:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, biz, strategy, discovery
```

### What NOT to Do

1. **Don't delete comments** without permission
2. **Don't over-engineer** - Only make requested changes
3. **Don't add features** without discussing first
4. **Don't ignore existing abstractions** - Reuse what exists
5. **Don't commit secrets** - Use environment variables

### Framework Alignment

When suggesting product features:
- Reference customer problems from `02_discovery/`
- Align with strategy in `01_strategy/`
- Check against product principles in `03_product/product_principles.md`

When suggesting technical solutions:
- Check architecture in `07_engineering/architecture.md`
- Follow tech stack decisions in `07_engineering/tech_stack.md`
- Create ADRs for significant decisions

### Communication

1. **Explain the plan first** - Don't code without confirmation
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - When requirements are unclear
3. **Show reasoning** - Explain why, not just what
