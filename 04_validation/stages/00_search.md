# Stage 0: Customer Discovery (Search)

> "Get out of the building." — Steve Blank

## Purpose

Find **Problem/Solution Fit** — Validate that:
1. The problem exists
2. The problem is painful enough to solve
3. People will pay for a solution

---

## Key Activities

### Talk to Customers

- [ ] Conduct 20+ customer interviews (see `02_discovery/`)
- [ ] Use The Mom Test — ask about past behavior, not hypotheticals
- [ ] Document insights, not just notes

### Understand the Problem

- [ ] Define the problem clearly (`02_discovery/problems/problem_space.md`)
- [ ] Identify Jobs to Be Done (`02_discovery/problems/jobs_to_be_done.md`)
- [ ] Map current alternatives and why they fail

### Identify Early Adopters

- [ ] Find people actively looking for solutions
- [ ] Find people who will try imperfect solutions
- [ ] Build relationships with 5-10 early adopters

## Common Mistakes
