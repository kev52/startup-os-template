# Product Principles

> "Product principles are a set of guardrails that help your team make day-to-day decisions." — Marty Cagan

## What Are Product Principles?

Product principles are not features or strategies. They are **decision-making guidelines** that reflect your values and help resolve trade-offs.

## Example Product Principles

_Use these as inspiration:_

| Principle | Trade-off |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Simple over Feature-Rich** | We'd rather do fewer things well than many things poorly |
| **Speed over Perfection** | We ship fast and iterate vs. waiting for perfect |
| **Opinionated over Flexible** | We make decisions for users vs. giving infinite options |
| **User Outcome over User Request** | We solve the real problem, not just what they asked for |

## How to Use

1. **Feature debates:** "Which option better aligns with principle X?"
2. **Roadmap prioritization:** "Does this feature reflect our principles?"
3. **Onboarding:** New team members learn how we think
4. **Stakeholder alignment:** Shared language for decision-making
