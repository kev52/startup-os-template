# Product Roadmap

> "The roadmap is a prototype of your product strategy." — Bruce McCarthy

## Roadmap Philosophy

- **Outcomes over output** — Roadmap items are problems to solve, not features to build
- **Flexibility over rigidity** — The further out, the less certain
- **Alignment over assignment** — This is for communication, not project management
